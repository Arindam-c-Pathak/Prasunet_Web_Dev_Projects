                <h3>Internship at Prasunet Company: Web development</h3>

			<h4>Web Development Project 1: Responsive landing page</h4>
				<p>This project required me to use different elements of languages such as CSS and JavaScript. First, the base of the webpage was made using HTML and had 				all the main parts such as navigation menu and the contents.</p>
				
				<p>CSS was used to design the webpage with different colours, sections and text styles.</p>
				
				<p>JavaScript was used to add interactivity such as text change on hover and the scrolling function with navigation links.</p>
				
				<p>Link to the projects can be found below:</p>

			<h4>Web Development Project 2: Stopwatch Web Application</h4>

				<p>This project was quite unique in nature as it reuired the use of Javascript more than HTML and CSS because there was need of multiple functions such that 				needed to be implemented.</p>
				
				<p>CSS was used to design the application features such as buttons and the base of application.</p>
				
				<p>JavaScript was used to implement functions such as Start/Stop, Lap and Reset. Each button had to made separately to it functions properly as 					intended.</p>

			<h4>Web Development Project 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application</h4>

				<p>Similar to the previous project, this one required more work on javascript than HTML or CSS. HTML only provided the base of the application, such as the 				cells where the markers would be placed and the box around it.</p>
				
				<p>CSS was used to give the application a style and colours that were needed to make its appearance better for the users.</p>
				
				<p>JavaScript is the thing running the game. The win/loss/draw conditions, the placement of markers and resetting the game were all functions made using 				javascript.</p>

			<h4>Web Development Project 4: Personal Portfolio Website</h4>

				<p>Most of the webpage was made in HTML as the majority of the content was text. The current page you are viewing is the result of this project.</p>
				
				<p>CSS was used to design the webpage with different colours, sections and text styles.</p>
				
				<p>JavaScript was used to add interactivity such as text change on hover and the scrolling function with navigation links.</p>

			<h4>Web Development Project 5: Weather App</h4>

				<p>A unique project in my experience. To make this Application, I had to gain access to an API (application programming interface) from a weather gathering 				ite. I used <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank"> OpenWeatherMap</a>'s API for this function. </p>
				
				<p>HTML was used to give the app its structure and CSS was used to design it.</p>
				
				<p>JavaScript was used implement the API into the app and use the functions of the API. The buttons and the interactive display was also implemented using 				language.</p>

                <h3>Internship at Prasunet Company: Data Science</h3>

			<h4>Data Science Project 1: </h4>

				<p>The purpose of this project was to create a Bar-chart/Histogram to visualise the distribution of the categorical/continuous variable such as distribution 				of age/genders in population in given <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL" target="_blank">dataset</a>. This wasn't a tough project to 				work on as the objective can be reached directly using microsoft excel. All the files generated in this project can be found below:</p>

			<h4>Data Science Project 2: </h4>

				<p>The objective of this project was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the <a 						href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data" target="_blank">Titanic dataset</a> from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify 					patterns and trends in the data. Using a python code to perfom the EDA and get all the graphs, I was able to create the graphs that were required.</p>

                <h3>Internship at Unified Mentor: Data Science</h3>

			<h4>Project 1: Foreign Direct Investment Analysis</h4>

				<p>Objective of this project was to understand the Foreign investmemts in different sectors between the years 2000 and 2017 in order to find trends. I was 				provided with the dataset and had to write a python code that could analyse the dataset and give some graphs for us to analyze. All the graphs were useful 				in coming to a conclusion that could help us find the sectors that had more investements and showed the most/least growth in over the years. All the files 				of this project, including a powerpoint presentation report can be found in the link below:</p>
